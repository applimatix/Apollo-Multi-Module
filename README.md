# Apollo-Multi-Module

This app explores the efficiencies that can be gained using multiple modules with Apollo in it's current state.

Specifically can fragments be shared across modules.

## Outcomes

Although somewhat expected from searching the internet regarding this issue, it is not possible yet to
get 2 self contained and non-dependant modules

## To run the app

1. Import the project into Android Studio
2. Install https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-faker
3. Run graphql faker using graphql-faker -o /.../ApolloMultiModule/apollo/faker/schema.faker.json
4. Build and Run the App which currently points to the server running on the localhost
